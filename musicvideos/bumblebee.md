Bumble Bee - Melissa St Moore
=====================

###Verse 1
Psychic fireflies ignite the night  		

Writing fortunes in the sky     		

and butterflies they fight but      	 

they don’t have fingers     	 

they don’t have tongues     	

they don’t have thumbs      	

###Chorus

I am aware if I jump into the ocean     	

There might be sharks and I might get cold      		

But if your there and you meet me in the nighttime      	 

it would be fun, watch the world undone     

###Verse 2


Smooth Lamborghinis on the loose        						 

And they speed on through the night     		

driving fugitives wherever they like        		 

from noon till one      	

so they get stuff done      		

###Chorus 2     

I am aware if I step into the ocean I might get bit     				 

And I might get stoned	        	

But when you come and you meet me in the middle	        	

It’s all okay and we float along.       		


###Ending       

strange crystal cats are playing games      		 

…………………………..        	

And we can’t hear them      	

with the white noise on     	


I am aware when I get up from a nightmare       		 

I might get rich quick I might have fun     		

But cause you’re there and you meet me in the middle        		

It’s all a dream and we float along.
