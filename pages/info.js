                        <p className="infoText">Melissa St Moore is an eccentric dream pop musician in Chicago, IL. She likes to
                        incorporate symbolism in her songs and sometimes paint pictures with words. Her self-titled debut is
                        available <a className="span-opport" href="https://melissastmoore.bandcamp.com/">everywhere</a>.
                        <br/><br/>
                        A self-taught dancer, conductor of her own train, and comedienne by circumstance, St Moore creates inner and
                        outer worlds with her creative mix of sound and vision that defies traditional genres. Her inspiration is
                        rooted in the music and art of the 1970s in NYC. Lately she has been listening to Santigold, Goldfrapp, New Order, 
                        and Peaches. As a performance artist, video antics and glitchy electronics lend themselves to high
                        energy vocals, and she has played in many venues throughout LA and NYC, including a spot opening for Nina
                        Hagen.
