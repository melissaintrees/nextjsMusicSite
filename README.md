I started coding, social media management, email marketing, and making videos to promote my music business in 2004. My music is recorded keyboards, drum machines, live instruments and vocals using a program Apple Logic. The current iteration of my music site was built using Next JS, though I often rebuild it using new technologies. 

Currently, I am scaling a digital marketing plan involving the promotion of a new material using a holistic ground up approach.
